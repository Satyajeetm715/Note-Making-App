# NotesShaala Overview

NotesShaala is a full stack note sharing platform built for students who need an easy and reliable way to exchange study materials. The platform provides a clean interface for uploading, browsing, and downloading notes, ensuring that learning resources are always accessible.

The frontend is developed using Next.js, which offers fast routing and a responsive user experience. The backend is powered by Express.js and manages all file related operations. Notes are not stored locally. Instead, the system uses the Google Drive API, where every uploaded file is securely saved in a dedicated Drive folder through a service account. This provides durability, controlled access, and scalable storage without server constraints.

NotesShaala is designed to be simple to operate, with a streamlined upload process and clear download options, making it ideal for students who want a centralized hub for academic notes. It can be expanded with authentication, filters, subjects, or user roles, depending on future requirements.
